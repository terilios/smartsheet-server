# Development Plan

## 1. Error Handling & Recovery (Completed)

- **Issues**: Basic error logging, no retry mechanism, limited error context, no cleanup on failures.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement structured error logging with detailed context.
  - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API failures.
  - Enhance error context in logs for better debugging.
  - Implement proper cleanup and resource management on failures.
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

## 2. Azure OpenAI Integration (Completed)

- **Issues**: Late deployment validation, no fallback mechanisms, missing rate limiting, inefficient token management.
- **Improvements**:
  - Validate deployment configuration at startup.
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures.
  - Add rate limiting to manage API requests efficiently.
  - Optimize token management for better performance.
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1.5 weeks

## 3. Batch Processing Architecture

- **Issues**: No job queuing, limited persistence, no recovery, hardcoded batch sizes, no progress tracking.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement a job queuing system with priority handling.
  - Enhance job persistence with a robust storage solution.
  - Add job recovery mechanisms for interrupted processes.
  - Make batch sizes configurable.
  - Implement detailed progress tracking and reporting.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

## 4. Smartsheet API Integration

- **Issues**: No rate limit handling, missing exponential backoff, no bulk operation optimizations, limited validation.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement rate limit handling with exponential backoff.
  - Optimize bulk operations to reduce API calls.
  - Enhance validation of API responses for consistency.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

## 5. MCP Server Architecture

- **Issues**: Limited health monitoring, no resource cleanup, missing connection management, limited telemetry.
- **Improvements**:
  - Add health monitoring and status endpoints.
  - Implement resource cleanup and management.
  - Enhance connection lifecycle management.
  - Add telemetry for performance monitoring.
- **Priority**: Low
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

This plan outlines the key areas for improvement, prioritizes them based on impact, and provides estimated effort for implementation.
